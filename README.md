# Pharmachiano ERP - Frontend

![Pharmachiano Preview](./assets/preview.png)

**Pharmachiano ERP** is a comprehensive retail pharmacy management system designed for multi-branch organizations. This frontend is built using **Next.js**, **Tailwind CSS v4**, **MUI**, and **Shadcn UI**, ensuring a modern, responsive, and fast user interface. It handles real-time sales, inventory management, role-based access, and analytics dashboards, providing a seamless experience for branch managers, sales personnel, and super admins.

This project is part of our **university final year project**, developed by a team of three. I was responsible for implementing the frontend and integrating APIs for real-time operations across multiple branches.
